# Hooked on React Hooks

This is part of a presentation I have where we explore the "under the hood" behaviors of common React hooks by building them from scratch.

The slides to which this presentation is a part of can be found [here](https://slides.kylewest.dev/hooked-on-usestate.html).

## Hooks covered

In order (because you can build new hooks from the previous ones)

- `useRef` 
- `useEffect`
- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`
- `useReducer`

## I just want the answers

That's fine, just take a look in the `freact-final` folder.

## Resources

API descriptions can be found in the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html).

Here is a link to [my website](https://kylewest.dev) with my contact info if you have any questions.
