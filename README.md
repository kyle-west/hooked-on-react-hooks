# Hooked on React Hooks

This is part of a presentation I have where we explore the "under the hood" behaviors of common React hooks by building them from scratch.

## Hooks covered

In order (because you can build new hooks from the previous ones)

- `useRef` 
- `useEffect`
- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`
- `useReducer`

## I just want the answers

That's fine, just take a look in the `freact-final` folder.
